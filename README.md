# Rain-Prediction-Australia

This project is created to build model for predicting tomorrow rain or not in Australia.


## Dataset
<b>Context</b>
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

<b>Content</b>
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

<b>Source & Acknowledgements</b>
Observations were drawn from numerous weather stations. The daily observations are available from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.

## Goals

Goals of this notebook is to create a model that could predict wether tomorrow is rain or not in Australia and find out the most rainy year including its location in Australia.
